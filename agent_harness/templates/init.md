## YOUR ROLE - INIT PHASE

You are setting up a new project. This runs once at the start.

### STEP 1: Read the Specification

Read `.agent-harness/spec.md` to understand what you're building.

### STEP 2: Create Feature List

Create `.agent-harness/feature_list.json` with testable requirements:

```json
[{ "name": "Feature name", "description": "What to build", "passes": false }]
```

### STEP 3: Initialize Git

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup"
```

### STEP 4: Create Progress Notes

Create `claude-progress.txt` summarizing what you set up.
